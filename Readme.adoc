== Overview
Intelligent IoT Gateway is a key component of enterprise Internet of Things (IoT) as it enables real time  decision-making at the edge, secures downstream devices and optimizes network utilization. In this lab, you'll learn how to build the Intelligent IoT Gateway with an Arm 64 platform - for this lab we used APM's Mustang platform but any other Arm 64 platform with RHEL should work as well. KEy components of the Gateway are:

* *Red Hat Enterprise Linux Developer Preview for Arm* to provide Enterprise class foundation
* *JBOSS Fuse* to transform sensor data and route it to end points
* *JBOSS BRMS* to enable real-time decision making at the edge
* *JBOSS A-MQ* to arbitrate sensor data


The first part of this lab is to install required software (Maven, JDK). Once the Gateway is provisioned, we'll put it into action by starting JBOSS Fuse, building & deploying the pre-built routing and business rules services. We'll then start sensor app that sends temperature data using MQTT to the JBOSS A-MQ broker. These messages will be forwarded to the services that we started earlier. Finally, we'll be creating the business rules to trigger desired action when the sensor value reaches a threshold. 

=== Requirements


=== Step 1 - Prepare the system

Enable the required repos, install maven, install fuse and clone the project:

 * Open a terminal and enter the following commands:

 
=== Step 2 - Start JBoss Fuse Server

 * Open a new shell and enter the following commands:

  [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd
  [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab
  [demo-user@iotlab IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runJBossFuse.sh

* Wait for the Red Hat JBoss Fuse to complete the start procedure

Red Hat JBoss Fuse needs to install the 'camel-mqtt' OSGi features to process MQTT messages. 

* Enter the following simple command on the 'JBossFuse' command prompt

 JBossFuse:karaf@root> features:install camel-mqtt
 
=== Step 3 - Build Software Sensor
 
For this lab, we’ll be using a software sensor that simulates a physical sensor. Defined by a few environment variables, software sensor creates random values and sends these to a MQTT Broker for further processing.

To be able to run the Software Sensor, it has to be built from the source files.

 * Open a new terminal and enter the following commands:
 
 [demo-user@iotlab IoT_Summit_Lab]$ cd Software_Sensor/
 [demo-user@iotlab Software_Sensor]$ mvn clean install

=== Step 4 - Build and Deploy Camel Route

The sensor data will be transformed and routed by a camel route provided in this project. Now we need to build the Red Hat JBoss Fuse project and deploy it to our running JBoss Fuse server. We’ll use the provided script to build and deploy the project.

 * In a new terminal, perform the following commands

 [demo-user@iotlab Software_Sensor]$ cd
 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/
 [demo-user@iotlab IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runRoutingService.sh

**We can verify that the Camel route has been deployed by logging into JBOSS Fuse admin cosole https://github.com/ishuverma/Virtual-IoT_Summit_Lab/tree/Virtual-Lab-1/RoutingService#verify-that-the-camel-route-has-been-deployed[see details]**

=== Step 5: Build and Run the *Business Rules Service*
One of the important functions of Intelligent IoT Gateway is trigger action if the sensor data meets certain condition defined by business rules. We've a business rules service that ensures:

1. Sensor data is read from a Message queue
2. Sensor data is handed over to the rules execution engine that triggers action per defined rules 
3. Altered data is placed into another defined Message queue

Lets build a new version of the service and start it.

 * Enter the following commands in a terminal

 [demo-user@localhost IoT_Summit_Lab]$ cd
 [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/
 [demo-user@localhost IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runRulesService.sh
 
It should display following output
 < output truncated >
 AMQ-Broker tcp://localhost:61616 ready to work!

 Device-Type = temperature
 Device-ID   = 4711
 Payload     = 70
 Result      = 1
 ----------------------
 Sending <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?><dataSet><timestamp>18.05.2016 10:46:22 766</timestamp><deviceType>temperature</deviceType><deviceID>4711</deviceID><payload>70</payload><required>0</required><average>0.0</average><errorCode>1</errorCode></dataSet>

=== Step 6: Test Rule Service
We will try this service by sending a test message via the *Software Sensor* to our setup. The following should happen:

*Software Sensor* sends a message with a high value via MQTT

*Routing Service* will pick it up, transform the message and send it to an AMQP message queue

*Business Rules Service* will take the transformed message from the queue and will put it in another AMQP message queue, but only if it meets the business rule condition
 


 [demo-user@localhost Desktop]$ cd
 [demo-user@localhost ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/
 [demo-user@localhost IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runHighSensor.sh

It should display following output
 
 Starting the producer to send messages
 Sending '70,0'

 AMQ-Broker tcp://localhost:61616 ready to work!
 Device-Type = temperature
 Device-ID   = 4711
 Payload     = 70
 Result      = 1
 ----------------------
 Sending <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?><dataSet><timestamp>17.05.2016 15:08:59 265</timestamp><deviceType>temperature</deviceType><deviceID>4711</deviceID><payload>70</payload><required>0</required><average>0.0</average><errorCode>1</errorCode></dataSet>
 ----------------------

Another way to verify that the message was properly processed is to take a
 look at Red Hat JBoss Fuse console via 'http://<ip address of Arm system>:8181', The count of messages enqueued and dequeued shoud now show that one message has been taken from 'message.to.rules' and placed into 'message.to.datacenter'.
 
_Note: Fuse console login/password is admin/change12_me_

Now we can use the `Software Sensor` to create a stream
of sensordata and will observe the effect our Business Rules from has
on the data.

nter the following commands in a new terminal

 [demo-user@iotlab Desktop]$ cd
 [demo-user@iotlab ~]$ cd IoT_Summit_Lab/
 [demo-user@iotlab IoT_Summit_Lab]$ ./runSensor.sh

The decision table can be updated with new rules to filter data i.e. what messages should be sent to the message.to.datacenter queue.

 ** Before the new rules can be applied, the running instance of `Business Rules Service` need to be stopped ( `CTRL-C` in the terminal session running Business Rules Service)

 ** Re-build & start the updated `Business Rules Service` and re-run the sensor
 
*The Intelligent IoT Gateway is now ready to work*
